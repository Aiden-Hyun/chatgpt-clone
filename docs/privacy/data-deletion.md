You can delete individual conversations without deleting your entire account.

3. Find the chat you want to delete
4. **Swipe left** on the chat, or tap the **delete icon**
5. Confirm deletion when prompted

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete a chat room:

| Data Deleted | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Messages** | All messages in that conversation (both yours and AI responses) |
| **Chat metadata** | Chat title, creation date, selected AI model |

### What Is NOT Deleted

- Your account information (email, name)
- Other chat rooms and their messages
- Your app preferences and settings

### Data Deletion is Immediate

- Deleted chat data is removed **immediately** from our servers
- There is **no recovery** once a chat is deleted
- This action is **permanent**

## Delete All Data

If you want to delete **all** your data, you can delete your account:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Data & Privacy** → **Delete Account**
2. Your account and all data will be deleted after 14 days
