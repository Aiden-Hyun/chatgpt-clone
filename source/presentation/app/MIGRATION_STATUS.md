# App Migration Status

## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Created `/source/presentation/app` directory
2. âœ… Copied all files from `/app` to `/source/presentation/app`
3. âœ… Created navigation utilities:
   - Created `navigationTrackerInstance.ts` in `/source/service/navigation/utils`
   - Copied `resetDebugGlobals.ts` to `/source/service/shared/lib`
4. âœ… Updated import paths from `/src` to `/source`
5. âœ… Replaced existing providers with `/source` equivalents
6. âœ… Replaced hooks from `/src` with hooks from `/source`
7. âœ… Replaced service configuration with `BusinessLayerProvider`
8. âœ… Set up `BusinessContextProvider` for the app
9. âœ… Updated navigation references to use `/source`
10. âœ… Created necessary hooks:
    - `useChatScreen` in `/source/shared/hooks`
    - `useModelSelection` in `/source/presentation/chat/hooks`

## Remaining Tasks

1. ðŸ”„ Testing the migrated app functionality:
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test navigation
   - Test chat functionality
   - Test settings

## Known Issues

- Some components may still need to be updated to use the business layer properly
- Error handling may need to be improved
- Some functionality might be simplified compared to the original implementation

## Next Steps

1. Run the app and test all functionality
2. Fix any issues that arise during testing
3. Gradually enhance the implementation to match the original functionality
4. Remove references to `/src` completely once the migration is stable

## Migration Strategy

The migration strategy involved:

1. Copying the app files to the new location
2. Creating necessary utilities and hooks
3. Updating import paths to use the new structure
4. Integrating with the business layer through the `BusinessContextProvider`
5. Testing and refining the implementation

This approach allows for a gradual transition from the old architecture to the new layered architecture while maintaining functionality.
