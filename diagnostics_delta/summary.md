# Delta Diagnostics - Phase 1 Summary

## Overview
Scan completed for 5 Phase-1 items with exact file/line references and pass/fail status.

## Results

| Item | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | ✅ PASS | MessageList uses id-based keys |
| 2 | ✅ PASS | SENT handler never marks user messages `processing` |
| 3 | ❌ FAIL | Assistant failure path: on AI error, assistant placeholder → `failed` (user stays non-failed) |
| 4 | ❌ FAIL | First-turn persistence uses `activeRoomIdRef.current` (value, not ref object) |
| 5 | ❌ FAIL | AbortController wired end-to-end: send → stream → cancel, with ignore-late semantics |

## Summary
- **2/5 items PASS** - Basic message handling works correctly
- **3/5 items FAIL** - Critical issues found in error handling, persistence, and cancellation

## Next Steps
See detailed findings in `findings.md` for specific file/line references and implementation issues.
