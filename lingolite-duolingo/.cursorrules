Project Tech Stack
Expo SDK 55, React Native 0.74, Expo Router v3, TypeScript strict, Supabase backend.
Use React Native StyleSheet or react-native-css for styling.
No Tailwind/NativeWind, no Zod, no Zustand, no TanStack Query.

Folder Conventions
/app → Expo Router routes (screens)

/src → components, contexts, hooks, utils

/supabase → SQL, edge functions, seeds
Keep business logic in /src, not inside /app screens.

Output Rules
Write code directly; summarise big edits in plain English.

Do not introduce libraries not listed in the tech stack.

Keep functions reasonably small (< 80 lines where practical).

Planning
When asked to PLAN, provide: vision, feature list, domain models,
architecture diagram, folder structure proposal, milestones, risks,
and the first 3 action items. Do NOT generate any code during planning.
