# SendMessage Module

This module handles the sending and regeneration of chat messages in the application.

## Structure

The module is organized into the following files:

- `index.ts` - Main entry point and controller for sending/regenerating messages
- `handleMessageState.ts` - REMOVED: Logic moved to ReactUIStateService.updateMessageState()
- `handlePostAnimation.ts` - Handles database operations after message animation
- `handleDraftCleanup.ts` - Manages draft message cleanup
- `handleNewRoomRedirect.ts` - Handles session storage and navigation for new rooms

## Key Fixes

### Regeneration Persistence Fix

The main issue with regenerated messages not persisting after refresh has been fixed in the `updateAssistantMessage` function. The key changes are:

1. First querying for the specific message ID to update
2. Explicitly updating the `updated_at` timestamp
3. Using the message ID for the update instead of filtering by multiple conditions

## Testing the Fix

To test that regenerated messages now persist after refresh:

1. Open the chat app and navigate to an existing chat
2. Click the regenerate button on an assistant message
3. Verify that the regenerated message appears in the UI
4. Refresh the page
5. Verify that the regenerated message (not the original) is displayed

## Debugging

Console logs have been added at key points to help track the flow of data:

- When finding messages to update
- When updating messages in the database
- When successfully updating a message

These logs can help identify any issues that might occur during the regeneration process.
